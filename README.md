# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.
 a web application designed to connect artists worldwide who seek collaboration on both physical and digital art pieces. Artists can create profiles showcasing their unique styles and portfolios, fostering connections with like-minded collaborators. The platform goes beyond the digital realm, allowing artists to organize local meet-ups or connect based on geolocation, enhancing both virtual and physical collaborations.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.
Artists face challenges in finding suitable collaborators, especially when seeking both digital and physical art collaboration opportunities. cokraft addresses this by providing a space where artists can connect, showcase their styles, and organize collaborative efforts, whether they are working together online or meeting locally based on zip code.



### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.
Artists of diverse backgrounds and styles will use the platform to connect with potential collaborators.  The platform should cater to artists ranging from beginners to experienced professionals.

### Features
